# hello-world
My First Repository

Hi,

My name is Lindel Smith. I am currently completing the tutorial for Github. I am here to learn how to code in hopes that I can find a job that will help me achieve my career goals. I would like to find a position as a software engineer or a data scientist. I am currently enrolled in Data Science/Big Data and Java Programming courses on Coursera and plan to start the FreeCodeCamp, so I can attain the skills needed to help me find my dream job!

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!
